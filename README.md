# SoftBody-Simulation
An Simulation of Softbody


This is a Python program that simulates a soft body using nodes and springs.
The program uses the Pygame library to create a graphical representation of the soft body on the screen.


The soft body is made up of interconnected nodes, which are represented as circles on the screen.
The nodes are connected by springs, which apply forces to the nodes and cause them to move.
The color of the springs changes based on their length, creating a visual representation of the tension in the soft body.


The nodes are affected by gravity and can be moved by the user's mouse.
When the program is running, you can move the nodes by clicking and dragging them with your mouse.
You can also adjust the parameters of the simulation.
